# Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing and visualizing data on bike sales to understand customer demographics, income distribution, commuting patterns, and the impact of various factors like age, gender, and region on bike purchases. The analysis is performed using Excel with pivot tables and charts, creating an interactive dashboard.

## Objectives
- Analyze income distribution across genders.
- Study customer age groups and their bike purchasing behavior.
- Investigate the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases.
- Understand regional and educational influences on bike sales.

## Dashboard Features
1. **Average Income by Gender**:
   - Visualized as a bar chart comparing male and female customers' income.
   - Segmented by bike purchase status (Yes/No).
2. **Customer Age Group Analysis**:
   - Line chart displaying the count of bike purchases across age groups (Adolescent, Middle-aged, Old).
3. **Commute Distance vs Bike Purchases**:
   - Line chart examining how commute distance influences the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
4. **Interactive Filters**:
   - Gender, region, education, and other demographic attributes can be filtered to analyze specific subsets.

## Insights
- Middle-aged customers show higher bike purchase rates.
- Shorter commute distances (0-1 miles) have the highest number of bike purchases.
- Males generally have higher average incomes, but gender differences in bike purchases vary by region.

## Challenges
- Managing and cleaning the data for consistent analysis.
- Designing a dashboard that is both visually appealing and informative.

## Future Enhancements
